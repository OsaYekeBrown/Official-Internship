# BridgeUPSTEM Internship

New York City is home to many diverse species of wildlife that arrived or existed long before humans settled here. In October 2016, Mayor Bill de Blasio launched WildlifeNYC, a citywide education and awareness campaign teaching New Yorkers how to live safely and responsibly alongside wild animals including deer, raccoons, and coyotes.

Urban wildlife is any wild animal that lives in an urban environment, such as New York City. Urban wildlife includes birds, mammals, reptiles, fish and amphibians. Some urban wildlife is native, like eastern grey squirrels, while some are non-native, like mute swans. Domesticated and companion animals, like dogs, exotic pets, and farm animals are not considered urban wildlife. Domesticated but feral animals like pigeons and stray cats are also not considered urban wildlife.

My internship was dedicated to learning about these NYC Wildlife and finding notable patterns and trends. Overall, this will culminate in an informational website made with HTML.
