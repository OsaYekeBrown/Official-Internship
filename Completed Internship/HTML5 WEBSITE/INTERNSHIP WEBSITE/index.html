				<p class="description">For our internship project we analyzed a data-frame which contains recorded information of wildlife living in New York City. During our analysis we observed trends, similarities and differences that presented themselves in the data. We were able to use qualitative and quantitative data to create visuals such as charts and graphs to present our findings. We believe our project would help bring awareness to those living in NYC and inform the public.
