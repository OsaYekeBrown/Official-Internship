				<p class="description">For our internship project we analyzed a data-frame which contains recorded information of wildlife living in New York City. During our analysis we observed trends, similarities and differences that presented themselves in the data. We were able to use qualitative and quantitative data to create visuals such as charts and graphs to present our findings. We believe our project would help bring awareness to those living in NYC and inform the public.

The red fox is nocturnal—a tough life in the city that never sleeps—and prefer to spend most of their time in the open, which is no easy feat with so many humans around. </span>

Infact, the population of red-eared sliders is booming in New York City, especially in Central Park and at Harlem’s Morningside Pond. As they grow large, they inadvertantly take food and basking space from native turtles. Inasmuch, they are routinely ranked among the world’s hundred worst invasive species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, according to National Geographic.</span>

The code represents this visually; the bar graph shows the frequency of animals spotted in Manhattan sans Central Park to preserve the scale of the graph scale and to properly represent the data (Over 300 animals).</p>

Forman et al. proposed that an animal's health may decline due to climate change, a prevalent and ongoing issue. Inasmuch, an animal's physical health can deteriorate because of climate change in four major wys: heat-related diseases and stress, extreme weather events, adaptation of animal production systems to new environments, and emergence or re-emergence of infectious diseases, especially vector-borne diseases (Forman et al., 2008).</p></div>
